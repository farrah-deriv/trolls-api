            <AccordionItem title="What is copy trading?">
                <p>
                    Copy trading allows a client (the Copier) to automatically copy the trades of another client (the
                    Trader).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To allow others to copy your trades, set the ‘allow_copiers’ setting via the{" "}
                    <Link href="/playground/#set_settings">set settings</Link> call.
                </p>
                <p>The Trader may create a read-only API token and provide it to the Copier.</p>
                <p>
                    Enabling ‘allow_copiers’ will also make the copytrading statistics call available. The statistics
                    call provides the information about an account. This is so that potential copiers have an idea about
                    the trader’s past performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start copying, use the <Link href="/playground/#copy_start">copy start</Link> call. To stop
                    copying, use <Link href="/playground/#copy_stop">copy stop</Link>.

                    website is online or not.
